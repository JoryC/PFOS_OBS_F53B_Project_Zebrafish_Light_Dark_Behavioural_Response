# PFOS, OBS, and F53B Zebrafish Light and Darkness Behavioural Response

The [Viewpoint ZebraBox and ZebraLab](https://www.viewpoint.fr/en/p/equipment/zebrabox-for-embryos-or-larvae) instruments and software were used to monitor the locomotion of zebrafish larvae (120hpf) over 50-minutes with an photoperiod dexcribed in Figure 3. 

The protocol file is included in this repository for simpler reproducibility.

HTML reports can be found in the Reports subdirectory and viewed using a web browser. 

The Output subdirectory contains the results of the ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett's test for each binning method, as well as a summary spreadsheet for each variable. Also, included in each variable subdirectory are locomotor suimmarized by minute and grouped by chemical. 

In the Data subdirectory, the raw data and metadata can be found in two seperate spreadsheets.
